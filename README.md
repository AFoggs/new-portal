Project 2 for Human Computer Intereaction: A redesign of the MyIIT Portal

Erin Baxter: Hi, I think my strengths are mainly basic html and also grid/baselines in css. Also if ask me for help I will try and answer as soon as possible.

Ore Olotu: Hey y'all. I'm pretty good with html and css (color and design). I know a bit of javascript and open to learning new things!

Antoine Foggs: Hola! So, I enjoy HTML and I like designing the entire functionality of a webpage, as well as the layout. I'm pretty busy, but if you need me to do something, just let me know and it will get done. I also tend to do things either really early or at the very last minute, so let's be all be early together!

Stephen Grzenia: yo, I would consider my strengths as the following; 1) I don't like to cause trouble in groups. If you want to do something and it isn't detremental to the project or just 100% incorrect, I support you. 2) My communication skills within groups. 3) When it comes down to the wire I will push everything aside to finish something(in this case, this project). 4) I guess I'm alright at HTML structure and being semantic and stuff. CSS isn't bad.
